# Voice

App for Home Assistant [voice control](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice_control/).

This app is a work in progress, so expect things to be unpolished!

## Installation and first boot

Installing the app can take quite a while, since it builds an optimized version of [llama.cpp] for your CPU.

On first boot of the app, the [LLM model](#conversation) must be downloaded (about 4GB). If you have a Hugging Face account, putting your token in the app settings (`hf_token`) may speed up the download.

Once the app boots, check "Devices & Settings" for a newly discovered voice conversation agent and add it. Select this agent in your voice pipeline, optionally checking "Prefer handling commands locally" if you want Home Assistant to try to recognize commands before sending them to the LLM.

## Conversation

An LLM [conversation][] agent built on [Gemma 4][gemma4] is used to recognize [intents][] from voice commands.

The Gemma 4 LLM is run on the CPU using [llama.cpp][] and a [quantized version][] of the [official model][]. Changing the quantization level, such as from Q5 to Q8, will change the accuracy, speed, and RAM usage of the agent.

The default model is a 5-bit (Q5) version:

- repo: `bartowski/google_gemma-4-E2B-it-GGUF`
- model: `google_gemma-4-E2B-it-Q5_K_M.gguf`

If you'd like to try the higher-precision official Q8 quantization, use these settings:

- repo: `ggml-org/gemma-4-E2B-it-GGUF`
- model: `gemma-4-E2B-it-Q8_0.gguf`

### Supported voice commands

Voice commands are implemented as [tools][] given to the LLM. When given a voice command, the LLM must select a tool to call and the appropriate parameters.

An important setting for tools is `include_names_in_tools`, which is enabled by default. This injects your [exposed entities][] and area/floor names into the tools themselves, allowing the LLM to have more context. This includes [aliases][] as well. While more accurate, this makes processing slower and increases RAM usage.

**Notes**

- Turning devices on/off only works for lights, switches, fans, media players, and input booleans
- Open/close commands work with covers and valves
- Some commands, like setting a cover's position or pausing a media player, require devices that explicitly support those features
- Playing music requires a Music Assistant media player that is also exposed to Assist
- Todo list names match what's in Home Assistant, so you can just name one "shopping list"

### Multiple commands

Gemma 4 can recognize and run multiple voice commands, such as "turn off the lights and lock the front door". This works best with larger models, such as the official Q8 version (see above).

### State caching

To keep the LLM speed reasonable, the agent caches the LLM state whenever the tools change. If you have `include_names_in_tools` enabled, which is the default, the cached state must be rebuilt whenever you modify your [exposed entities][] and restart the app.

Rebuilding the cached state can take several minutes.
